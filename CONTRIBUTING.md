Overview
===
Formalize each and every tag in Stacks project.  Each section should be in a separate file.  The stacks project is mostly self-contained, but if some preliminary is required (e.g., basic facts about groups), put the file under the `Foundation` directory.

Naming convention
===
Follow the [naming convention](https://github.com/arend-lang/arend-contrib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) of arend-contrib.

Comments
===

Each tag in Stacks project should be discussed.  Use comments to mark corresponding parts in the source.  If some items are not applicable (e.g., automatic in the type-theoretic setting), explain why no code is needed in comments.  If the formalization is notably different from the set-theoretic setting, explain how hPOV simplifies or complicates things with comments starting with "hPOV:".
